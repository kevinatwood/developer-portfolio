# Developer Portfolio

## Description

I created a profile of my work and projects with no starter code using HTML and CSS. This is my introduction to future employers and collaborators and showcases some of my work in my coding bootcamp and other projects. I was able to implement flexbox and mobile first design to create a responsive webpage that can be viewed on devices with different screen sizes. The UI scrolls to the appropriate section when clicked on, the work section will eventually display links to projects that I have completed as I gain more experience, and the first project image is larger than the others.
